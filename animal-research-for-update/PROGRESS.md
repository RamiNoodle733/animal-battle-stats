# 225-Animal Research Overhaul Progress

- **Target:** 225 animals
- **Completed research files:** 141 / 225
- **Verified full-body transparent PNGs committed:** 0 / 141
- **Research source list:** `../DATA_PROGRESS.md`
- **Output directory:** `animals/`
- **Status:** In progress
- **Most recently completed:** Narwhal (*Monodon monoceros*)
- **Next pending animal:** Nautilus
- **Latest completion:** 2026-09-22 02:00 America/Chicago
- **Latest new-animal image status:** Narwhal - `REPLACEMENT SOURCE NEEDED`. Broad search found reusable NOAA and Commons photographs, including a public-domain explicitly male tagging photograph and a 2868x2040 reusable wild image, but no candidate simultaneously establishes healthy adult status, one-animal complete tusk/head/body/flippers/flukes framing, adequate quality and reuse provenance. No PNG completion claimed.
- **Latest legacy image audit:** Mantis Shrimp - `SOURCE FOUND - FULL-BODY NOT VERIFIED`. A much stronger 5290x3527 CC BY-SA 4.0 Cédric Péneau source is explicitly assessed by Wikimedia Commons as a whole-body wild *Odontodactylus scyllarus* showing all leg types, but adulthood is not explicit, so the mandatory adult criterion remains unresolved.
- **Next legacy image audit:** Marlin. Hellbender, Hornet, Ibex, Kudu and Lionfish are source-verified and awaiting binary cutout/commit tooling.
- **Latest checkpoint:** `audits/CHECKPOINT-125.md`; next checkpoint at 150 completed research files.

## Selection and image rules
Each run uses `DATA_PROGRESS.md` ordering but ignores its old checkmarks, choosing the first roster animal without a completed staging report. `IMAGE_REQUIREMENTS.md` is mandatory and retroactive. Research completion and image completion are separate counts. A URL, JPEG, candidate PNG or uninspected cutout is not a completed image.

## Active normalization / uncertainty notes
- Ratings are absolute across all 225 animals, not pound-for-pound.
- Unsupported bite-pressure values remain 0.0. Force is never converted to PSI without defensible contact area.
- Maximum speed remains 0.0 where no defensible species-specific maximum exists. Observed cruise, track or sustainable speed is not silently promoted to a physiological ceiling, and speed is not Agility.
- Stamina separates sustained movement from burst speed.
- Special must not double-count ordinary size, toughness, cognition, flight or sociality.
- Pack/flock/colony behavior can raise Tactics contextually but does not multiply one individual's Raw Power, Attack or Defense.
- **Narwhal control:** *Monodon monoceros*, healthy prime mature male, 1200.0 kg / 460.0 cm body length / 0.0 m/s unsupported maximum / 100.0 y age-model maximum expectancy / 0.0 PSI. Attack 61.0 / Defense 59.0 / Agility 51.0 / Stamina 92.0 / Intelligence 74.0 / Special 90.0. Tusk is treated as a sexually selected sensory/status structure with real reach, not as a guaranteed lethal spear. Direct tag speeds are not promoted to physiological top speed.

- **Mountain Goat control:** *Oreamnos americanus*, healthy prime mature male, 110.0 kg / 100.0 cm shoulder / 165.0 cm head-body / 0.0 m/s unsupported maximum / 14.0 y / 0.0 PSI. Attack 51.0 / Defense 42.0 / Agility 88.0 / Stamina 70.0 / Intelligence 62.0 / Special 78.0.
- **Moray Eel control:** Giant Moray *Gymnothorax javanicus*, healthy large mature adult, 25.0 kg / 220.0 cm / 0.0 m/s unsupported maximum / 39.0 y demonstrated age / 0.0 PSI. Attack 49.0 / Defense 32.0 / Agility 74.0 / Stamina 51.0 / Intelligence 70.0 / Special 86.0.
- **Moose control:** *Alces alces*, healthy prime mature bull, 550.0 kg / 200.0 cm shoulder / 300.0 cm total length / 15.6 m/s secondary-source maximum / 15.0 y / 0.0 PSI. Attack 69.0 / Defense 50.0 / Agility 58.0 / Stamina 70.0 / Intelligence 55.0 / Special 60.0.
- **Monitor Lizard control:** *Varanus salvator*, mature large male, 20.0 kg / 200.0 cm. Attack 48.0 / Defense 35.0 / Agility 73.0 / Stamina 57.0 / Intelligence 64.0 / Special 67.0.
- **Mongoose control:** Javan Mongoose *Urva javanica*, mature male, 0.8 kg. Attack 20.0 / Defense 16.0 / Agility 86.0 / Stamina 62.0 / Intelligence 64.0 / Special 66.0.
- **Monarch Butterfly control:** *Danaus plexippus*, mature migratory male, ~0.0005 kg. Attack 1.0 / Defense 15.0 / Agility 82.0 / Stamina 90.0 / Intelligence 43.0 / Special 89.0.
- **Megalodon control:** †*Otodus megalodon*, IRSNB P 9893 reconstruction, ~30,000 kg. Attack 100.0 / Defense 96.0 / Agility 58.0 / Stamina 92.0 / Intelligence 58.0 / Special 88.0.
- **Meerkat control:** *Suricata suricatta*, mature male, ~0.75 kg. Attack 18.0 / Defense 17.0 / Agility 82.0 / Stamina 65.0 / Intelligence 88.0 / Special 78.0.
- **Marlin control:** Blue Marlin *Makaira nigricans*, mature female, 250.0 kg. Attack 58.0 / Defense 41.0 / Agility 78.0 / Stamina 90.0 / Intelligence 62.0 / Special 70.0.
- **Mantis Shrimp control:** Peacock Mantis Shrimp *Odontodactylus scyllarus*, mature large male, 0.08 kg. Attack 34.0 / Defense 24.0 / Agility 84.0 / Stamina 50.0 / Intelligence 68.0 / Special 97.0.

- **Elk comparison control:** *Cervus canadensis*, mature bull 320.0 kg. Attack 62.0.
- **Duplicate-roster control:** `Anaconda` and `Green Anaconda` currently both resolve to *Eunectes murinus* / green-anaconda complex and should remain normalized until explicitly separated or merged.

## Checkpoints
`audits/CHECKPOINT-125.md` reviewed inflation, inverted comparisons, compression, proportional-strength leakage, speed/agility confusion, double-counting, weak sourcing and duplicate ability concepts. No prior staging score required correction. Next checkpoint: **150 completed research files**.

## Image pipeline status
141 research reports are complete, but **0 verified transparent PNG binaries are committed**. Hellbender, Hornet, Ibex, Kudu and Lionfish have reusable full-body source candidates, but current connected GitHub `create_file` / `update_file` actions accept UTF-8 text only. No JPEG rename, base64-text pseudo-PNG, opaque checkerboard or other fake image is created. Megalodon additionally exposes a structural rule conflict for extinct animals because the mandatory standard requires a real photograph of an adult. `IMAGE_BACKFILL.md` remains the legacy audit queue.
